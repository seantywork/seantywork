## This is all because of (or thanks to) ChatGPT

It's been only a year and a half at this company so I can't call myself an expert\
but from what I've heard from those who were before me and my brief though turbulent experiences,\
the period transitioning from the end of the year to the beginning of the coming year is when \
the developers here should be ready to do some intense crunching.

Because, due to the nature of the company R&D department where I work, it is the period when the managers and leaders of on-going projects are required to \
turn in both quantitative and qualitative results garnered throughout the year, the bid announcement for new government-funded projects is made\
and the sales pitches are drawn up ceaselessly until a blueprint for the coming year starts to materialize.

And the gigantic difference in the main themes surrounding the sales pitches being drawn up this year 2023 compared to the year\
before or even the preceding all those years followed by it was, yes, **Chat GPT**.

In South Korea, as the government tried to reign in the overall fiscal spending which includes national R&D budget, many projects that were \
directly or indirectly involved in the government funding were affected by the move and many previous blueprints or the sales pitches based\
on them were reduced in size or even entirely scrapped. 

Except one field (generally speaking).

The AI hype triggered by Chat GPT and the following prospect of "ROBOT RULES!!!", \
AI/Robotics has become the next place our sales pitch should head to as it was purported\
that that was virtually the only place the assignment would go up, not down.

The only problem was that in robotics, we had no serious real experiences nor references.
