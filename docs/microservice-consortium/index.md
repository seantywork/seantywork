## The first impression

When I had explored Docker and Kubernetes by myself before landing the job, the word "microservice" must have been entirely elusive or physically never \
present before my eyes, or I could have answered the question by the interviewer (currently my supervisor) "What is microservice?" 

I had no idea at first when I've heard the word "microservice" and "MSA" what those meant.\
My initial inernal reponse was that it sounded very much like a word in a scammer's dictionary, such as DeFi, and smart contract.\
I tried to fabricate a probable answer by collecting every single piece of information scattered around my brain, but failed miserably.\
Only after the interviewer mentioned "Docker", could I bounce back and start say something I knew.  

Back then, I regretted not paying enough attention to the official documents and reading materials.

But now in hindsight, that attitude towards the technology, which was kind of upside down as I put in 30% of efforts in scheming through\
the docs and then 70% fighting errors to get things up and running was what made possible the currently on-going project of developing \
a multi-cluster orchestrating layer added upon the great Kubernetes container orchestration system, which is the road undocumented and \
ridden with errors ,malfunctions, and unexpected negative surprises.
