## Lucky man

Let me be frank.

I viscerally doubted, and had second, third, fourth, and even fifth thoughts if I had picked the right company and \
not chosen to step into the dead-end of my career that hadn't even started\
when I belatedly visted company website three days after I got a call that I got the job.

I'm no designer of any sort, but the appeareance of the website was sincerely discouraging for the new recruits like me\
as it resembled the look of the numerous half-baked pages of web vulnerability examples I'd encountered \
when I was trying to get a taste on how to identify and exploit weak websites.

The most appalling moment of it all was when I tried to connect the site thourough https:// channel.\
It just simply didn't have the https working.

But, as soon as I bounced back from dismay and started to look for the bright-side, I could see one thing might be working\
for my own benefit. And that was the possibility I could at least leave a positive mark on the executives mind by\
installing the https channel. I was able to identify the company website server was using nginx as its reverse proxy (and this,\
as it turned out to be, wasn't quite what I had thought it would be and gave me some headache), and voila!, I certainly have\
experience with that, including enabling https connection.

So, when I eventually set foot in the company as an employee for the first time, what was there in my heart was a bit of \
curiosity mixed with anticipation that I could pull out something right away.

The opportunity came unexpectedly swiftly.
