## Lucky man

Let me be frank.

I viscerally doubted, had second, third, fourth, and even fifth thoughts if I had picked the right company and \
not chosen to step into the deadend of my career that hadn't even started\
when I belatedly visted company website three days after I got a call that I got the job.
