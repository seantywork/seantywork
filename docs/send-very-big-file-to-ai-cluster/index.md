## The doctor, the mentor, and an idiot

Except a very few projects that are in Java, Go, C++, Python, the most of my company's works are in Javascript.

And I was the only one in the whole company who had never seriously used Javascript for any projects\
when I started working here, which in turn might have been, in hindsight, the primary reason why I was picked to assist my mentor\
in the company by managing Linux server and the reverse proxy alongside the fact those were things in which I could say I am fairly well\
seasoned compared to other NodeJS masters (who were also very busy) in the company.

Back then, as I was just onboarding the team and my heart was filled with the desire for the recognition, I really hoped someone along the\
decision tree would miraculously choose Go or C++ for the implementation of "the doctor's" request, but that didn't happen obviously.
