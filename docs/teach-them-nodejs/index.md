## Do not follow my way

When I started working here, I had never used NodeJS but almost 90% of the company projects, especially those active ones, were\
in Javascript/NodeJS.

Even worse, there was no such thing as "company education" or anything remotely similar to "learning session." Anyone onboarding\
was his or her own including me with only a template ExpressJS project given to a newcomer to "process and understand" for a week\
and then the freshman was allocated right away after that period.\
No assesement, no feedback, no nothing.\
Not that I hate that, but that was just the way it was.\
(Even myself writing it down cannot believe that was the story but everysingle bit of it is true)

This was partly the reason I've been put to work on microservice project that uses Go (based on my C/C++ and Linux experience) right away\
and stay mainly there afterwards.

It was definitely not an ideal situation but could remain a manageable one so long as there is no expectedly constant influx of new recruits\
and that was the case for the time being.

But it soon turned upside down as the number of the company's active projects ballooned by almost 100% as we entered 2023. 

We need to post new recruit announcement and I was anxious.
