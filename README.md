# Yet Another Mindless Linux-junkie :zany_face:

## For those interested in the projects:

Refer to /docs for each project

If no /docs is there for you to read, then it means you have to parse the whole code by yourself, which is rarely commented :)

Though I'm tryting to work on that...

Oh, by the way, even if there IS /docs, it doesn't guarantee the code becomes understandable and readable because I'm

suuuuuuuuuper lazy to keep them up to date ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

And also, repositories that don't start with a hex sequence are forked or have some external origins equivalent to fork

## For those with some weird and unlikely impulse to look deeper and find out more about me and the surrounding world:

[Random, Inconsistent, Preposterous, Surreally Enormously Abnormal Nonsense](https://seantywork.github.io/seantywork/)

Previously, I uploaded some none-dev-related matters on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@seantywork),

but at some point I thought my life would be better off merging it into this place and did so, because, after all,

I have to get back here anyway to do some real fun work.

Added to this, I also have a [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-taehoon-yoon/) account, but s**t is hardly given to it.
