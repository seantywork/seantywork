# Yet Another Mindless Linux-junkie :zany_face:

## For those interested in the projects:

Refer to /docs for each project

If no /docs is there for you to read, then it means you have to parse the whole code by yourself, which is rarely commented :)

Though I'm trying to work on that...

Oh, by the way, even if there IS /docs, it cannot be guaranteed that the code becomes  understandable and readable because I'm

suuuuuuuuuper lazy to keep them up to date and to articulate the content enough

for everybody ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

The projects that are pinned down below are the ones most actively engaged with and most interested in for now.


## Insignificant reference

I am uploading some none-project-related matters onto [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@seantywork),\
and artifacts produced when writing those may (or may not) be found in [this special repository](https://github.com/seantywork/seantywork).\
again, refer to /docs of this repository to get a grip


## Even more insignificant reference

Added to that, I also have a [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-taehoon-yoon/) account, but s**t is hardly given to it.

Good day!
