# Yet Another Mindless Linux-junkie :zany_face:


## Insignificant reference

[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@seantywork) is where I'm documenting some none-project related materials.

However, be extra cautious when you visit the site or intend to learn anything from here and there:

### NEVER TAKE THEM TOO SERIOUSLY ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Very often, a cat's meowing has more meanings in it than them.

Good day!

## Some good materials that I think need attention to...

[Death by Thousand Microservices](https://renegadeotter.com/2023/09/10/death-by-a-thousand-microservices.html)

[9 MONTHS WITH GPT-4: CAN I FIRE MY DEVELOPERS YET?](https://blog.boot.dev/computer-science/ai-taking-programming-jobs/)

[Less is exponentially more](https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html)

## For those interested in the projects

The projects that are pinned down below are the ones most actively engaged with and most interested in for now.

I'm trying to get the docomentation for each to catch up but...

So sorry so far!

Anyway, some simple explanations for each are:


- hack

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can think of it as curry sauce for Linux, </br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because everything I encounter, be that C/C++ codes, commands, shell scripts, Go codes, Python and Javascript codes </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is thrown in there. I personally use it as a quick search using Ctrl+F, and you can too if you want :)


- sorrylinus

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the project built with C to primarily control my AC from outside my house. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It cosists of TCP/TLS socket hub for authenticating a remote machine (primarily Raspberry Pi) and </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delivering messages between the machine and the user server, </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the HTTP & WebSocket server (the user server) for authenticating user and </br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; communicating with the socket hub, both deployed on Kubernetes. </br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a perk, I can check out my cat's funny face whenever I want and share it with other people. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Take a look](https://feebdaed.xyz/) (if you want)



- no kube in the ass

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long story short, this is an added layer written in Go for managing multi-cloud based Kubernetes cluster </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with aggregation into other projects within the organization in mind. 

- kubernetes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Production-Grade Container Scheduling and Management that I love and contribute to </br>
