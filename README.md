# Yet Another Mindless Linux-junkie :zany_face:

## For those interested in the projects:

Refer to /docs for each project

If no /docs is there for you to read, then it means you have to parse the whole code by yourself, which is rarely commented :)

Though I'm trying to work on that...

Oh, by the way, even if there IS /docs, it cannot be guaranteed that the code becomes  understandable and readable because I'm

suuuuuuuuuper lazy to keep them up to date and to articulate the content enough

for everybody ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

And also, repositories that don't start with a hex sequence have some external upstream that I'm not in control of, except for this special repository

The projects that are pinned down below are the ones most actively engaged with for now.


## Insignificant Reference

I am uploading some none-dev-related matters onto [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@seantywork),

Added to this, I also have a [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-taehoon-yoon/) account, but s**t is hardly given to it.
