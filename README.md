# Yet Another Mindless Linux-junkie :zany_face:

## For those interested in the projects:


Refer to /docs for each project

If no /docs is there for you to read, then it means you have to parse the whole code by yourself, which is rarely commented :)

Though I'm trying to work on that...

Oh, by the way, even if there IS /docs, it cannot be guaranteed that the code becomes  understandable and readable because I'm

suuuuuuuuuper lazy to keep them up to date and to articulate the content enough

for everybody ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

The projects that are pinned down below are the ones most actively engaged with and most interested in for now.


## Insignificant reference

[Hack](https://github.com/seantywork/hack) repository functions as the primary destination for stuff not directly involved with projects.

[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@seantywork) is where I'm uploading some none-prject-related matters,\
and artifacts prodeced when writing those may (or may not) be found in the repository mentioned above.\
The recent six articles published on the platform are listed below.

## Even more insignificant reference

Added to that, I also have a [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-taehoon-yoon/) account, but s**t is hardly given to it.

Good day!
