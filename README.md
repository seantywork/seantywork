# Yet Another Mindless Linux-junkie :zany_face:


## Insignificant reference

I'm documenting some none-project related materials and they are accesible on [GitHub Page](https://seantywork.github.io/seantywork/).

I also try to share things on [Medium](https://medium.com/@seantywork).

However, be extra cautious when you visit the site or intend to learn anything from here and there:

### NEVER TAKE THEM TOO SERIOUSLY ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Very often, a cat's meowing has more meanings in it than them.

"A cat" I mean whose life I truly and viscerally envy.

Take a look at him from [seantywork/sorrylinus/hub](https://feebdaed.xyz/)

Good day!



## For those interested in the projects

The projects that are pinned down below are the ones most actively engaged with and most interested in for now.

I'm trying to get the docomentation for each to catch up but...

So sorry so far!

Anyway, some simple explanations for each are:


- hack

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can think of it as curry sauce for Linux, </br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because everything I encounter, be that C/C++ codes, commands, shell scripts, python codes, </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is thrown in there. I personally use it as a quick search using Ctrl+F, and you can too if you want :)


- sorrylinus

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the project built with C++ to primarily control my AC from outside my house. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a perk, I can check out my cay's funny face whenever I want and share it with other people


- no kube in the ass

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long story short, this is an added layer for managing multi-cloud based Kubernetes cluster </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with aggregation into other projects within the organization in mind. 


- kubernetes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think I have to explain this. So far, though I'm trying, I've gotten only one PR merged. 


- zoom-o

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is to try to mimic Zoom as simple as possible, with some willing colleagues from my company.
