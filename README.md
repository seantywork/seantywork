# Yet Another Mindless Linux-junkie :zany_face:


## Insignificant reference

[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@seantywork) is where I'm documenting some none-project related materials.

However, be extra cautious when you visit the site or intend to learn anything from here and there:

### NEVER TAKE THEM TOO SERIOUSLY ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Very often, a cat's meowing has more meanings in it than them.

Good day!



## For those interested in the projects

The projects that are pinned down below are the ones most actively engaged with and most interested in for now.

I'm trying to get the docomentation for each to catch up but...

So sorry so far!

Anyway, some simple explanations for each are:


- hack

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can think of it as curry sauce for Linux, </br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because everything I encounter, be that C/C++ codes, commands, shell scripts, Go codes, Python and Javascript codes </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is thrown in there. I personally use it as a quick search using Ctrl+F, and you can too if you want :)

- ap2ko

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; router/modem access point that can directly control custom network drivers </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from browser  </br>


- sorrylinus

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the project built with C++ to primarily control my AC from outside my house. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a perk, I can check out my cat's funny face whenever I want and share it with other people. </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Take a look](https://feebdaed.xyz/) (if you want)


- multi terminal games

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an another project built with C++ and gRPC to mitigate my irrational anxiety that terminal interface </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is headed for the extinction. Long live terminal!!


- no kube in the ass

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long story short, this is an added layer written in Go for managing multi-cloud based Kubernetes cluster </br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with aggregation into other projects within the organization in mind.
