## For those interested in the projects

Refer to /docs for each project

If no /docs is there for you to read, then it means you have to parse the whole code by yourself, which is rarely commented :)

Though I'm trying to work on that...

Oh, by the way, even if there IS /docs, it cannot be guaranteed that the code becomes  understandable and readable because I'm

suuuuuuuuuper lazy to keep them up to date and to articulate the content enough

for everybody ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

The projects that are pinned down below are the ones most actively engaged with and most interested in for now.


## Insignificant reference

I'm documenting some none-project related materials [right here](https://github.com/seantywork/seantywork).

I also upload to [Medium](https://medium.com/@seantywork) but the frequency has somewhat dropped as I'm trying to concentrate my works at one place.

Good day!
