# Yet Another Mindless Linux-junkie :zany_face:

## For those interested in the projects:

Refer to /docs for each project

If no /docs is there for you to read, then it means you have to parse the whole code by yourself, which is rarely commented :)

Though I'm trying to work on that...

Oh, by the way, even if there IS /docs, it cannot be guaranteed that the code becomes  understandable and readable because I'm

suuuuuuuuuper lazy to keep them up to date and to articulate the content enough

for everybody ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

And also, repositories that don't start with a hex sequence are forked or have some external origins equivalent to fork, except for this special repository

Those projects that are pinned down below are the ones most actively engaged with.


## Insignificant Reference

Previously, I have been uploading some none-dev-related matters onto [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@seantywork),

but at some point I thought my life would be better off merging it into this place and did so, because, after all,

I have to get back here anyway to have some real fun.

Added to this, I also have a [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-taehoon-yoon/) account, but s**t is hardly given to it.
